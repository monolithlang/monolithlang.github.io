# Introduction

Monolith is very similar to the C Programming Language, some princips taked from C and Rust.
I wanna make an ideal and powerful programming language for developing maintainable software. As of right now, I donâ€™t  know any languages suitable for my purposes.

Monolith arose with several thoughts about: 
> Create programming language that can be used as a main tool for complexity development maintainable software for all categories until to a death.

Monolith can be used for develop low-level software and components like a OS (Operating Systems), drivers, system software, for develop maintainable software like a browsers, desktop application, bots and other.

## Futures
- Fast and optimized compilation
- Incredible perfomance
- **Safety**: no null (cannot derefer null pointer), no globals, no UB (Undefined Behavior)
- **Backend**: uses LLVM as backend or native code generation with supporting a lot of most popular architectures.
- **Transpiler**: can be fast transpiled to other languages by progressive AST to C, C++, Go, Python ...
- **Compilation**: simple and easy cross platform compilation for most popular OS and architectures ...
- **Size**: by aggressive optimizing and native code generation can give small sizes at or less than C
- **Syntax**: simple but productive syntax without unnecessary keywords and constructions

At the current moment Monolith written for **25%**.
