# 1.2 Comments and documentation

Comments very similar to C, Rust but takes documentation conception from Go|Rust with some mixed improvements.

```rust
// Oneline comment
// Oneline but with multiline style

/**
 * Multiline
 * C-styled comment :)
*/

/// `mul` documentation function.
/// ...
/// ...
func mul(a, b int32) -> int64 {
    ...
}
```
